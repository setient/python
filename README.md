python
======

Everything in this repo is random python scripts that I worked on for work or just for fun.  I am trying to learn python and most of these are either interview questions I found online, possible actual interview questions I have received or stuff from my work.

####vm-create
vm-create.py is a python script to create vm's.  It expects you to have an AWS account, environment variables set (they are named in the script), and some security group created.  It requires Boto, argparse.  It needs a few things to work correctly.  You should edit it to have some default security groups.  The --security group option does not work right now.  

####depend
This is a script I wrote that was an interview question I found.  I will be adding the instructions here too in the pdf file.  

####three
This displayes the 3 lines of /etc/passwd with the highest UID's.  Its nothing special.
